<h4 class="green-color">Assignment 4: Custom AngularJS Service</h4>
<p>The What-If Anaylsis table above utilizes a custom AngularJS service to save not only the center square of data but any square that the user selects. The What-If component also highlights the data in the table that has been saved. Preservation of data to the AngularJS service can be verified by navigating to another assignment and then back to this one.</p>
